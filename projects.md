A few of the projects I devote variable amounts of energy to in my spare time.
### Fight the Brain
This is a project exploring the 100+ cognitive biases and logical fallacies that influence our judgement.

Every week I dig into a single bias (Attribution Bias, Recency Effect, etc) with a few examples and explore how it can creep into professional and personal situations.

My goal is to better understand my own thought patterns to improve my decision-making and self-awareness in both professional and personal situations.

### Deep Dives
Long running project to write deep dives on subjects I feel strongly about, know a lot about, or want to learn more. Sort of a knowledge base of my brain.

My roadmap includes personal finance, product management, and fitness in your 30s. I'll start to dump them here when they materialize.
